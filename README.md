# Quick Reboot
![Icon](https://github.com/eradicatinglove/Quick-Reboot/blob/main/icon.jpg)


just a quick way to reboot your modded mariko switch.

No longer have to power off or restart manually with power button. 

the reboot should pick up the payload for hekate and boot back into it. 

*unpatched and erista will need Hekate.bin replace/renamed with reboot_payload.bin in sdmc:/atmosphere*
