# Quick Reboot
![Icon](https://github.com/eradicatinglove/Quick-Reboot/blob/main/icon.jpg)


just a quick way to reboot your modded mariko switch.

instead of having to power off or restart. 

the reboot should pick up the payload for hekate and boot back into it. 

tested this on instint v6 . havent tested on any other types.
